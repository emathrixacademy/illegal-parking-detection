streamlit
firebase-admin
pandas
plotly
Pillow
```

4. **If it already exists, click on it and edit:**
   - Click the **pencil icon** (Edit this file)
   - Make sure it contains exactly this (no extra characters):
```
streamlit
firebase-admin
pandas
plotly
Pillow
```

5. **Commit the changes:**
   - Scroll down
   - Click **"Commit changes"**

## **📋 Step 2: Fix the SyntaxError (Invalid Character)**

The third error shows `SyntaxError: invalid character '+' (U+2192)` which means there's a special character in your code.

**This might be an arrow character `→` instead of regular characters.**

### **Check your Python files on GitHub:**

1. **Open `pages/3_📈_Analytics.py`**
2. **Look for any arrow symbols `→` or special characters**
3. **If you find any, delete and retype them as regular characters**

**The filename itself might be the issue.** Try renaming:
- From: `3_📈_Analytics.py`
- To: `3_Analytics.py` (remove the emoji)

**To rename on GitHub:**
1. Open the file
2. Click **pencil icon** to edit
3. Change the filename at the top
4. Remove the emoji from the filename
5. Commit changes

**Do the same for all page files:**
- Rename `1_📊_Dashboard.py` → `1_Dashboard.py`
- Rename `2_🚨_Live_Violations.py` → `2_Live_Violations.py`
- Rename `3_📈_Analytics.py` → `3_Analytics.py`

## **📋 Step 3: Force Streamlit Cloud to Redeploy**

1. **Go to Streamlit Cloud:** https://share.streamlit.io/
2. **Click on your app**
3. **Click the menu (⋮)** → **"Reboot app"**
4. **Wait 2-3 minutes** for redeployment

## **✅ Alternative: Simplified File Structure**

**If errors persist, let's simplify. Here's what your GitHub should look like:**
```
illegal-parking-detection/
├── streamlit_app.py
├── requirements.txt
└── pages/
    ├── 1_Dashboard.py
    ├── 2_Live_Violations.py
    └── 3_Analytics.py
```

**Notice:** No emojis in filenames!

---

## **🔍 Verify requirements.txt Format**

**Make sure `requirements.txt` looks EXACTLY like this (no extra spaces, no version numbers for now):**
```
streamlit
firebase-admin
pandas
plotly
Pillow
```

**Each package on its own line, nothing else.**

---

## **📝 Updated requirements.txt with Versions (Use This Instead)**

If the simple version doesn't work, try with specific versions:
```
streamlit==1.29.0
firebase-admin==6.3.0
pandas==2.1.4
plotly==5.18.0
Pillow==10.1.0
